- Problem;
  - Dirt is discarded almost anywhere everywhere.
  - Environmental Polotion.
  - Bad odour everywhere.
  - Collected dirt is not sorted to diff categories, making some garbage that could've been recycled and re-used, thrown away.
  - Some, locations deep in our quartiers are almost never reached by our HysaCAM company, due to their geo graphical terrains
  - In some locations, HysaCAM would rarely come over.
  - Some people in locations without public dirt-bins end up discarding in sensitive environments like water.
  - Some people end up burning their dirt, and in most cases they do it in ways that tend to harm our environments

- Solution;
  - Offer ways to go deep into some remote areas, and personally collect garbage,
  - Collected garbage is sorted and the recycleable ones are re-recycled and or sold to garbage re-cycling orgs here in camair.
  - Decomposing these to manure.

- How they make money;
  - By selling recycled or recycleable material.
  - By getting subscriptions to coming in remote areas and carrying away dirt.

- Pre Seed Funding Ask
  - Land rent 3 million.
  - Trycycle rent for moving to these areas.
  - For building a site that talks about them.
  - For publicity, facebook adds, and all.
